# Improve_Inventory_Management-
Poor inventory management leads to a loss in sales which in turn paints an inaccurate picture of lower demand for certain items, making future order predictions based on that past data inherently inaccurate. Instead, smart retailers use real-time data to move inventory where it’s needed before it’s too late. Additionally, they use predictive analytics to decide what to stock and where based on data about regional differences in preferences, weather, etc.
